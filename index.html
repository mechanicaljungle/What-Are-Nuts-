  <h2>What is Non-Load Bearing Walls?</h2>
<a href="https://civiljungle.com/differences-between-load-bearing-and-partition-walls/">Non-Load Bearing Walls</a> do not support the load of the roof upstairs. It is not part of the structural framework system. In most cases, it is the inner wall that aims to divide the floor into rooms. Downloaded walls can be identified by beams and beams.
<h3>Types of Non-Load Bearing Walls</h3>
Followings are the type of non-load bearing walls based on the used wall unit:
<ul>
   <li>Hollow Concrete Block Wall</li>
   <li>Facade Bricks Wall</li>
   <li>Hollow Bricks Wall</li>
   <li>Brick Walls</li>
</ul>
Brief descriptions of these types of non-load bearing walls are given below:
<h4>Hollow Concrete Block</h4>
The walls of the concrete building were hollowed out. It has the advantage of high resistance. Provides stability without wasting material.
<h4>Facade Bricks</h4>
Robust and durable, virtually maintenance-free. The color of this brick does not lose its luster. Fa√ßade bricks are environmentally friendly and sustainable.
<h4>Hollow Bricks</h4>
They are a green life. They can reduce the use of air conditioners. They are strong and most often used. Hollow bricks are beneficial.
<h4>Brick Walls</h4>
It is an immovable brick block or wall. Brick walls are easy to install.
<h2>What is Load Baring Wall?</h2>
A load-bearing wall (or load-bearing wall) is a wall that carries the load on it by carrying its weight to the foundation structure.
The most commonly used materials for building bearing walls in large buildings are concrete, blocks, or bricks.
Load-bearing walls support loads from structures such as floors, equipment, furniture, and people.

In the past, buildings were built with very thick brick walls that support the entire floor and other loads. The design of these walls was not based on engineering data, but only on good faith but unscientific building codes. As the building grows, the building code requirements for brick wall thickness become economically affordable.

> Krunal Rajput:
Depending on the type of building and the number of floors, the bearing wall is measured to an appropriate thickness to support the weight, but otherwise the outer wall may become unstable when the load exceeds the strength. The structure of the material used can collapse.
<h2>Types of Load Bearing Wall</h2>
Load-bearing walls may further be divided into the following types
<ul>
   <li>Solid masonry wall</li>
   <li>Cavity wall</li>
   <li>Faced wall</li>
   <li>Veneered wall</li>
</ul>
<h3>Solid Masonry Wall</h3>
Hard masonry walls are most commonly used. These are walls constructed of blocks of individual materials such as bricks, clay and concrete blocks, stones, etc., usually running horizontally and glued with suitable mortar.
The solid wall structure of the same building type collapses through its entire thickness. However, it can be an opening such as a door or window.
<h3>Cavity Wall</h3>
A retaining wall is a wall consisting of two sheets, each plate consisting of a structural unit, separated by a cavity and connected to a metal flange or connecting unit, where the two sheets are a single structural unit. To function as. The space between the sheets can be left as a continuous cavity or filled with unloaded insulation and waterproofing.
Clad wall and sheet metal wall
<h3>Faced wall and veneer wall</h3>
A cladding wall is a wall in which the cladding and back are made of two different materials and are combined to ensure collaboration under load. Veneer walls are similar to unloaded walls in that they weigh less than your own.
The bricks or tiles are mounted on the back, but do not perform any common actions with the background.
Probably the most commonly used brick veneer in wooden houses. Other examples are the architectural cotters of monumental buildings and fine ceramic veneers.
